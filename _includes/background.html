      I'm currently on the data & analytics team at <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.slalom.com/" target="_blank">Slalom</a>, where I focus on data engineering within product teams. I love bringing a data-centric perspective to conversations with product owners, designers, engineers, and (most importantly) users when designing new products and systems.

      I have a bachelor's degree from the business school at the <a class="underline-link" href="https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/" target="_blank">University of Minnesota</a>, where I also completed a minor in computer science. This combination of technical understanding and business savvy allows me to clearly explain and teach detailed technical concepts to non-technical audiences. For my <a class="underline-link" href="https://github.com/carstonhernke/dockless-scooter-analysis" target="_blank">honors thesis</a> I analyzed the usage and equity of dockless scooters in the Minneapolis area using geospatial techniques.

      When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I enjoy running (check me out on <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/17954486" target="_blank">Strava</a>), open-water swimming, and cross-country skiing. I love learning new things and am currently working towards fluency in Norwegian - <i>jeg har en lang vei å gå...</i>
