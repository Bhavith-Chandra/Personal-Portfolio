      I love seeing data projects all the way from idea to execution. My unique experience spanning software development and consulting means I can see all the way from business value to implementation details.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my latest role, I worked as a Senior Analytics Engineer at <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.tier.app/en/" target="_blank">TIER Mobility</a> in Berlin, Germany. At TIER, I helped build data products for our partner cities, including Berlin, Paris, and Oslo. One of the projects I'm most proud of is the Bike Lane Analysis, where I combined usage data from our vehicles with Open Street Map data to show cities the gaps in their bike lane networks.

      Prior to joining TIER, I was part of the Data & Analytics team at <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.slalom.com/" target="_blank">Slalom Consulting</a>. At Slalom, I was a data engineering consultant that worked with digital product teams at a variety of companies.

      I have a bachelor's degree from the business school at the <a class="underline-link" href="https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/" target="_blank">University of Minnesota</a>, where I also completed a minor in computer science. For my thesis <a class="underline-link" href="https://github.com/carstonhernke/dockless-scooter-analysis" target="_blank">I analyzed the usage and equity of scooters in the Minneapolis area</a> using geospatial techniques.

      When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I enjoy running (check me out on <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/17954486" target="_blank">Strava</a>), open-water swimming, and cross-country skiing. I love learning new things and am currently working towards fluency in Norwegian - <i>jeg har en lang vei å gå...</i>
